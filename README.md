# Sudoku Solver App

A sudoku puzzle game coded in swift that the user can choose to attempt to solve themselves, 
or they can choose at any point during the game to give up and see the computer solve it for them. 
At the moment the game only uses precoded puzzles 

## Important note

I realized that someone in my presentation group had the same idea as me, so to prevent a full repeat presentation in the
same group, I swapped the ideafrom a sudoku solver web app to a mobile app. 
However I was already done with the game and the solving algorthm in python by the time I decided to swap. As such all the
commits you see on this Repo are from when I translated my python code to swift and designing the front end aspect of the game
All the commits related to me designing the game portion aand the solving algorithm can be found at the following repo:
